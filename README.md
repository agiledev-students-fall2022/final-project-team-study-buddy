## Description

*Study Buddy* is a way for students to ensure they can always find the resources they need with just a quick search. The app will be a hub for finding organizations that provide services like computer/internet usage, printing, copying, etc. Organizations will also be able to "claim" their profiles to provide a more accurate description of their services.

At its most basic implementation, *Study Buddy* will be a web app able to show students where free Wi-Fi, cheap/free printing, and study spaces are available. Clicking any of the services will launch a map that allows the user to show them nearby. Venues will also have their own information pages.

## Project History

Way before we had the idea for *Study Buddy*, we knew we wanted to make an app that would have a positive impact in a tangible way. During our first brainstorming meeting, one of our teammates was talking about how difficult it could be to find Wi-Fi or a quiet place to study when unavailable at home. They went on to mention that having a place to find those resources would have been really useful to them. This issue resonated with the rest of the group, so we decided it was the problem we wanted to solve!

Upon doing some more research, we discovered that millions of US students struggle to complete their schoolwork due to not being able to find or access the resources they need to succeed. This can stem from economic/circumstantial hardship, learning disabilities, or simply a lack of time management skills (which can lead to the stressful task of trying to find a printer two minutes before class starts).
