# User Experience Design

This repository contains instructions and files for two assignments that together comprise the user experience design phase of a web app.

Replace the contents of this file with the completed assignments, as described in:

## Source "Code"

Figma doesn't really do source code, but the Figma file for all wireframes, app maps, and prototyping can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/elW8VWpDluqxDMTjpH1CLI/Study-Buddy?node-id=0%3A1)

## Prototype 

You can view and/or interact with the full prototype on Figma [here](https://www.figma.com/file/elW8VWpDluqxDMTjpH1CLI/Study-Buddy?node-id=0%3A1) for both mobile and desktop


## App Map 

The app map for this project looks like the following:

Since we're going with a simple interface, we wanted to minimize the amount of pages a user can visit. For this reason, the flow is pretty linear. 

## Wireframe

The home page of the website is fireframed as the following: 

![](/ux-design/Wireframe%20mobile.png)

Once the user selects the resources they need and enter on the location they'll be redirected to a list view of places that match their query:

![](/ux-design/Wireframe%20mobile-2.png)

From here, they can click into the resource and view it in more detail:

As expected, this is the general flow the team has decided on but is subject to change as the scope of the project does.
