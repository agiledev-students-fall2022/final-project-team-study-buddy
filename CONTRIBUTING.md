## Team Norms
### Team Values
Unfortunately, our team's schedules are not that compatible so we plan to meet virtually. We will work together mostly on our private discord server, which has channels for important links, questions, daily updates, and meeting notes which will our workplace clean and professional. There are also separate voice channels, one for the bi-weekly meetings and one for team members helping each other with questions or solving problems.

_Resolving Conflicts_
Disagreements on direction? On major conflicts, get input from everyone and weigh the opinion of the person with the most experience more. Since we have an odd number of team members we can vote and majority wins. On minor conflicts, 

What to do when a member is failing to deliver on their obligations to the team: Members are expected to report regularly and especially in case unexpected events intervene with the workflow. If a member goes MIA, the other team members will give them three days to reach out, a full week before contacting the professor.
how quickly team members are expected to respond to messages directed at them.

Messages directed at a person should be responded to by the team member within 24 hours.

### Meeting Times
- The Scrum Master will create weekly When2Meets to set up two virtual scrum meetings a week.
- The group will provide daily updates in the private discord server in the dedicated channel. This is so the team can know what everyone is up to and when members are busy or having something come up.
