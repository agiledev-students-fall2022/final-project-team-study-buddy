## Team Norms

### Team Values

Unfortunately, due to incompatibility in our team's schedules, we mostly plan to meet virtually. We will work together primarily on our private discord server, which has channels for important links, questions, daily updates, and meeting notes which will our workplace clean and professional. There are also separate voice channels, one for the bi-weekly meetings and one for team members helping each other with questions or solving problems.

### Resolving Conflicts

With regards to directional disagreements:
- On major conflicts: everyone will give their input. If there is a person(s) with more experience than the others, their opinion will be considered the expert opinion (and therefore weighted more than the others).
- On minor conflicts, since we have an odd number of team members, we can vote on a solution and always have at least a simple majority.

Members are expected to report regularly and especially in case unexpected events intervene with the workflow. If a member goes MIA, or is otherwise failing to deliver on their obligations to the team, the other team members will give them three days to reach out, a full week before contacting the professor.

Messages directed at a team member should be answered within 24 hours.

### Meeting Times

- The Scrum Master will create weekly When2Meets to set up two virtual scrum meetings a week.
- The group will provide daily updates in the private discord server in the dedicated channel. This is so the team can know what everyone is up to and when members are busy or having something come up.

### Coding Standards

Pull request review requires at least one approval.

## Git Workflow

We will utilize [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/agiledev-students-fall2022/final-project-team-study-buddy/projects) to organize each sprint. As ideas move through the project, they'll move between the categories named Sprint Backlog (for user stories), To-Do, In Progress, Awaiting Review, and Done.

## Rules

- If a member will miss a meeting, they must notify at least 24 hours in advance.
- If a member wants to integrate a new or different library, they must notify the other group members first.
- Every merge must first be reviewed by another group member.
- During the meeting, when assigning user stories members must come to a general consensus on and estimate of how long the story should take.
- In the case where a user story is not completed on time, either the product owner or scrum master should pick up the slack.
